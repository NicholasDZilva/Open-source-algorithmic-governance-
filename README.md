**Purpose:**  
- The TSSL v2 framework is **not prescriptive governance**.  
- It is designed to be **open, auditable, and contestable**.  
- Intended for researchers, civic groups, or developers who wish to explore trust, integrity, and coherence in governance systems.  
- The paper and code together provide a **democratic counterweight** to opaque or proprietary algorithmic systems.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Review the Python code (`TrustScoreSystemV2`) — every line is documented and auditable.
3. Run the example simulation to observe trust dynamics, coherence divergence, and integrity signals.
4. Adjust weights, history window, and network size to simulate different governance scenarios.
5. Use results as diagnostic insights — **do not treat as prescriptive commands**.
